Earlier in the month we ran [BASH Festival of Code](https://bashfestival.io) - a free, week-long coding festival for 13-17 year olds across the UK. It comprised of 5 events throughout the week (Monday - Friday) - 4 during the week in London, Sheffield, Southampton and Plymouth, and a weekend finale in Birmingham. 

Throughout the event, young people (most of whom already had some experience in programming) build projects around our themes supported by adult mentors. It was a chance for them to apply their existing skills and have a collaborative environment to further build upon them.

## Why did we run BASH

There are many organisations out there who teach young people how to code and they’re fantastic. The challenge comes once they outgrow these programmes — our aim was to continue to support these engaged young people past the first step and give them the space to establish peer-to-peer skills sharing.

By virtue of the means needed to develop technical skills, and the fact that young people can do so alone, they often do, and it remains a relatively isolated activity. Our secondary aim of BASH was to provide a sense of community for these technical young people both regionally and nationally with the finale.

## We needed support

Of course, setting out to run 5 complementary events in 7 days was never going to be possible with our current small team. While we run many events across the year, there's only so many of us to go around. In order to make BASH Festival of Code happen, we needed some more hands. 

Cue our wonderful Hub Leaders. Chris, Elbrie and Sanzi headed up the Plymouth, Southampton and Sheffield events respectively. In the weeks and months leading up to the event, they found some great spaces, supported outreach in their regions and made sure that all parties knew what was going on (not just attendees and volunteers, but also parents). 

During the events we also had support from experienced mentors to support the young people in building their projects, and volunteers to make sure they all ran smoothly. We are hugely thankful for their support. 

Thank you to all the organisations and individuals who supported this initiative. Through them we were not only able to run our finale, but also offer assistance to families who might not be able to afford the travel to the events. In a retrospective blog post next week we will outline all of our sponsorship and spending in our commitment to transparency.

## Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

From the very start of the event we laid out our [Success Framework](https://bashfestival.io/about/success) - a set of goals that we would be able to measure our event against once completed. We'll be going through this more in detail in our retrospective next week, but for now we wanted to mention a couple of key parts. 

As mentioned above, through our sponsorship we were able to offer travel bursaries to those who needed them. We ensured (as with all of our events) that were was a minimal barrier to qualify for one. From the £1,000 we had available, we gave out £484.18. The remaining amount will go towards our inclusion scholarships for our [January conference](https://yougotthis.io).

We also decided a month before BASH Festival of Code that we would change one key part of the structure - instead of a full 7-day event with a travel component, we split the week events from the finale, allowing young people access to either or both parts. Instead of needing to be in range of a regional week event, young people were now free to attend the finale from anywhere across the country (with the access scheme fund making this more feasible). We were happy to hear that this had a positive impact on some attendees we would not have otherwise had. 

For this summary we also wanted to present our audience demographics. While we did not match our goals, we are pleased with this as a starting point.

## Feedback from attendees

In terms of skills - we had attendees learn about web design, Python and JavaScript at pretty much every event. In Southampton we had lots of skills growth around Unity and a few physical computing projects across the board with one attendee saying they learnt how to up-cycle old electronics. 

Most attendees were already pretty set in their further education choices, but some say they’re more likely to now explore university or apprenticeships as a result of attending BASH. For some this was their first time on a university campus, and learning more about specialised computing courses has made them consider specialising. 

Attendees really valued the open and casual atmosphere where they are free to self-guide their learning and have support on-hand if needed. Here are some quotes they left us:

> BASH Festival is very likely to cater for what you are looking for. Whether you want to learn new skills or continue to grow old ones BASH can be a great help. It really allows you to give you options for the future or really open your eyes to choices you can never thought of. 

> Showing up on Saturday I was a little hesitant, after an hour it was all gone and little did I know the two days of this event would be the best two days I've had all summer. I have no negatives to say except that I wish the events were longer. Thank you for giving us an THE BEST TWO DAYS. It felt like I was stealing the entire time I was there, I felt guilty that we were being spoiled so much. The food, the staff, the attendees, the Auditorium - we loved every bit of the event. THANK YOU!

> I had a really good time meeting people who were interested in similar stuff to me and making a finished product. 

> BASH Festival of Code gave our group an opportunity to learn lots of new skills in a fun, relaxed environment, and over the week we created something we were really proud of!

> BASH Festival is a great hub for young programmers to experiment and collaborate with others, a great environment for budding or even beginner programmers to excel

## Our take aways

This event was hard - a lot harder than expected. As a company we have not run a youth tech event before, and while it was broadly succcessful it comes at significant effort, time and money investment. We run events all the time, but the absolute requirement to build safeguarding procedures that are both robust and easy to execute took a lot. 

There is also a question of attendance vs impact. We had originally set out to run an event for 250-350 young people, and we ended up with sub-100. We are firm believers that we'd rather have a small number of engaged minds who get more value than the numbers without the impact, however this is significantly less participants than we expected or wanted. While this doesn't matter for us the numbers was one of the bases for our converastions with sponsors, which added another concern around this event. Fortunately, it seems many of our sponsors agree with our assessment of impact being greater than attendee numbers.

Our outlook is that no process is without flaw and anything we do once we can do again better in the future. We've set the precedent for how we make youth tech events meaningful and achievable. The next goal for us must be how to refine this to continue running impactful youth tech events.

We aren't going to run this event in this format again. We'll outline more in our retrospective some of the challenges we faced, but for running it again we will need some time to develop a fresh format that delivers more impact and is more sustainable for our team.

Ultimately we glad that we did this, and that we had a great group of people and organisations who bought into the vision. We had a really big impact on several young people - and that's what it's all about.
