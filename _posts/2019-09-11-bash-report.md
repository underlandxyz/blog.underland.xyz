A couple of weeks ago we wrote up our [highlights for BASH Festival of Code 2019](/2019/bash-highlights). It’s a good summary for how we did and what we learnt. This is our full retrospective, which hopes to explain in much more depth everything we did well, and what we learnt could be improved. 

Our hope is that by having spent the time to put this together we can provide some insight to other potential event organisers so they can apply our learnings. 

So, make a big cup of tea and get comfy. It’s not exactly a short read...

## 1. Inception and Format <a name="inception"></a>

With the place for community in technology being self evident, by extension so is the need for future facing communities. In the last 10 years movements have come along to establish a platform for younger people to find space in a community that invites their interest in technology, but they have also gone, leaving a lot of lessons to be learnt on why youth tech events are needed, but that they also need to be the right events.
 
In part, it would not be unreasonable to say that this is where Underland comes from in trying to address this need. Even though the world is becoming ever more connected and accessible through technology, programming is a skill which is becoming easier to explore in isolation. The need to bring together these young people and allow them to build a sense of community is more important than ever. The events and initiatives of years past have also helped inform the needs of this community.
  
In short, minimal barriers to participation, and where we can’t remove them, doing the most we can to reduce the impact on involvement. This had to be the same for any, and every, young person who might want to get involved.
 
Free to attend? Yes, and wherever else possible as close to cost neutral as we can make it.
 
Local and accessible, so that young people can meet others in their town or region who share their passion? Absolutely. Meeting other people that we might learn from, or even teach something to, who we might go on to study or work together in the future, is a great thing to have for a young person who might otherwise not so clearly know where the line is between a humble hobby or a solid career aspiration.
  
A safe and secure environment and experience in which young people can express themselves technically and autonomously? We expect it for ourselves as adults, and even fight for it when we aren't afforded these fundamental things, and young people deserve nothing less.
 
With these key factors in mind, we were intent on there being as much flexibility as practical to keep remaining barriers to participation from conflicting with involvement.
 
With this we created a goal: 
 
> A week-long festival for young people, 13-17 years of age, with some technical knowledge who would attend coding camps in their local region from Monday to Friday, before travelling to a national conference where they can show projects they've built, attend workshops and talks, and get to know other young people across the country just like them.

## 2. Success Framework <a name="success"></a>

For Underland, this goal was an immediately relatable one that we could look at from both sides.
 
What would we as our younger selves expect from attending the BASH Festival of Code if we knew what we know now?
What are our current expectations of what it should be, knowing that our younger selves don't necessarily have any expectations or fixed aspirations?
 
Planning a format and content in a manner that ticks boxes and meets a rigidly defined criteria can be great for a specific audience, but we would run the risk of as much telling our attendees who they should be, or whether they ought to consider themselves as succeeding or failing at being themselves.
 
To us this wasn't the point of what BASH Festival should be about, so while our criteria are logistically or practically meaningful where necessary, the development of our framework was deliberately written in broad strokes. Participation and engagement from whoever ended up coming to BASH Festival would always be seen as a positive net result, because in our view keeping expectations modest is the fairest way for the attendees ultimately to make the most of the event on their own terms, something that formal education and even life as a young person doesn't always afford them.

## 3. Assembling the Team <a name="team"></a>

Underland in itself is a small company, but it's part of a big family in the technical community, and finding committed and proactive people who at some point looked a lot like the audience for BASH Festival was as much a pleasant part of the process as it was instrumental to building a robust team.
  
> BASH Festival is a brilliant opportunity for youngsters who love to code. They get to grow and develop with help from industry mentors. I'm proud to have been able to support Underland to deliver it with my personal time.
-- Lewis Westbury - one of our team members working on event outreach

The overwhelming upside of this was that despite some team members having little to no familiarity with each other, there was no discernible “warm-up” period needed to let people gel and find their place amongst the rest. If we were to prescribe a causality to this advantage, it would be that with their time being given freely, and motivated by their genuine desire to have a positive impact, our team was inherently cut from similar cloth. Everybody was willing to take the initiative and go the extra mile, and to be contactable in advocating for why the BASH Festival of Code mattered.

Beyond the core team we needed to recruit volunteers to run the regional hubs and support the conference on the weekend, so our thoughts turned to safeguarding again because this was for us a firm baseline. Every person working on the project had to be supported by a current and enhanced background check. This was an absolute cornerstone of our commitment to making sure that the BASH Festival was an event that young people could attend safely and with confidence, however this came at an administrative cost that we had to take the initiative on absorbing into our overall budget.

Before we continue we wanted to actually thank the wonderful team who worked on this event:
* Sanziana Chiorescu, who supported the regional hub leaders
* David Durant, who helped organise volunteers & mentors
* Bethany Loft, who handled all things data and ensured our DBS checks were being processed in good time
* Anni Chen, who created an amazing content schedule for the weekend and worked with speakers/workshop facilitators
* Joshua Simpson and Poppie Simmonds, who helped support throughout in various capacities 
* Lewis Westbury, who supported outreach efforts to schools and community groups
* Ben Howe, who stepped in and made sure the weekend ran smoothly

This doesn’t even start to include the amazing volunteers we had support during the week or weekend - more about them later! 

## 4. Sponsorship <a name="sponsorship"></a>

This was the single hardest event sponsorship raise our team has ever encountered, but really this says a lot about the sponsorship that was ultimately secured. As an investment, the rewards are largely philanthropic. Positive association by involvement is at times only worth as much as a favourable “slow news week”, and any return by way of feeding back future employees, apprentices or similar are an unknown quantity. These factors come together and make our ask a pretty big one.

The other side of this coin however, is that the proof of concept was the existence of Underland and companies like us, start-ups and technical entrepreneurs the world over, even the very individuals who came together to make up our team. Where there was sponsorship to be found, it came alongside the most supportive and engaged minds that also believed wholeheartedly in what the festival represented.

![BASH Festival sponsors: Wildrocket, Createk, Samsung Internet, Rolls-Royce, Balsamiq, DigitalOcean, UKGovCamp, Front-Line Tech, mongoDB, The Panoply, @adamamyl, In Other News by @puntofisso, BGL Group and Barclays](/assets/posts/bash-sponsors.png)
 
Where we asked for funding towards the Festival's costs, the reply from sponsors were an assortment of offers including Barclays and Rolls Royce providing workspaces to host a couple of the regional weekday camps, and personnel to volunteer as hub leaders and mentors, even offering to lay on catering in the spirit of partnering up our need for funding alongside their own investment in education remits. The demands in return were little to none, coming in the form of offers to deliver workshops or presentation content, even careers guidance. The signs were all strongly indicating that these sponsors were the right ones to share our vision of what the BASH Festival of Code was all about. The support from Digital Ocean even came in the form of our Access Scheme, £1000 that was available as bursaries towards assisting with attendance where economic circumstances might prevent young people from taking part.
 
These are some examples of more specific sponsorship or partnerships we forged with this event, but there was obviously a need for hard cash to pay for most of the event expenses. In a later section we’ll break this down more fully. 

## 5. The Regional Hubs <a name="hubs"></a>
 
The question of how many week events and what capacity they could accommodate was originally capped by the where we would hold the conference, and geographically the most suitable location we found was Millenium Point in Birmingham. This afforded us an auditorium size of 350 and worked with our projected budget so that we could set up 13 hubs accommodating 25 young people each with London being able to host 50 young people.

With these parameters coming together we could begin connecting suitable locations with skilled hands that could operate as ‘hub leaders’ for their regions, providing the much needed conduit for local connections, and insight that would be invaluable in recruiting participants. At this point a lot of steps fell into place in quite an organic fashion, and having the advantage of some existing links with professionals, this furnished us with willing hub leaders and sourced suitable host venues.
 
Development of a training plan for all of the hub leaders was done within Underland, as this was an area where we could afford to be strict in our expectations of what we wanted each hub to have in terms of facilities, ensure a degree of standardisation across them so that there was a common experience for attendees, and making sure that we could be strict in the most important area of all, which was again, safeguarding. 

Alongside the development and delivery of the training plan we again wrote our own in-house policies governing every aspect of how we intended the event to run, including comprehensive guidelines on codes of conduct and safeguarding. We published all of our policies on the event website.
 
As an overall logistics-heavy phase, where we were dealing with exact and precise factors everything was relatively straightforward, however the most inexact and unknown factors were now coming into play – outreach.

## 6. Recruitment, Outreach and Publicity <a name="recruitment"></a>
 
Initially, we looked at volunteers during the week (‘mentors’) and those volunteering during the weekend (‘volunteers’) as two separate streams of recruitment - given that the former needed some technical skill and the latter less so. 

In a few cases we were lucky enough to find a package of a skilled hub leader, a suitable venue and available mentors all in one location by virtue of existing technical and educational projects. In others we found that we only had one or two of the elements available, and no manner of additional outreach efforts made any significant impact on this.
 
In the first wave of outreach and recruitment, we operated on the basis that hub leaders would be able to make use of their local insight to best recruit mentors and volunteers, and collectively they as a team would be able to tap into local avenues of publicising the event to young people through schools and clubs, press and other region-centric avenues. This was all feeding into the core team handling the background checks and formal registrations of mentors and volunteers while the ticketing system for places available was handled on an application basis.
 
The reality we found was that this didn't yield the uptake of mentors and volunteers and the hub leaders were in some cases having to juggle managing the outreach to young people for filling the spaces against finding people to assist them in this. As an adjustment measure, Underland reshuffled some of our attention between national outreach and local, allocating additional help to specific regions and getting in touch with a mix of groups whose existing networks we could get some exposure alongside.
 
For the most part, this was still not resulting in consistent results across all regions, and the biggest issue was a wave of interest/availability as the months went on. Combined with the broad impression we were getting from conversations with other practitioners during the outreach process, running the festival as a school holidays event took out a significant period of time from what is traditionally set aside for summer activities by families, and the time commitment to attend was too costly.
 
With the Festival being aimed at young people already with some initial interest or skill in coding, we anticipated that the number of available spaces in each reason would not suitably serve the number of applications and we would need to exercise some examination of the applications to make sure it was the right event for the young person applying.

As the target audience was specifically young people with some existing technical skills, we anticipated lots of applications - some from complete beginners - which we would have to assess on a case by case basis as to whether this was the right programme for each applicant. With a lack of numbers in the application period, we decided to adjust the system to open ticketing on a first-come, first-served basis.
 
At the same time, we further refined some of our outreach tactics, allocating more focused efforts to the core team, and exploring some additional mechanisms such as paid adverts over social media. As we started to get quite close to the festival itself, and many of our spaces remained empty, along with feedback from parents and practitioners in tech education, an idea formed to change a fundamental part of BASH...

## 7. A Change of Format <a name="format-change"></a>
 
It was a real shame to see that in some cases we had extremely engaged hub leaders but the applications for places at the Festival were just not forthcoming, or we simply didn't have the supporting mentorship coming forward in the right areas that we needed them. In one or two cases we were deeply grateful to see mentors willing to travel some way to attend a neighbouring region, however in areas where we simply didn't have the numbers to support running the hub we had to make a call on cancelling them, instead focusing efforts in areas where we had more engagement.
 
In the process we had to re-examine what was the biggest obstacle and young people being able to take up places, and again the lengthy time commitment of the Festival had to be considered. Parents were getting in touch regarding clashes with other family commitments or holiday activities and we made the decision to decouple the weekday coding activities from the weekend finale.
 
Unexpectedly this was an answer to several issues. Initially we had hub leaders planning group travel from their respective locations for their hub attendees to Birmingham and back on the weekend, a situation which raised various logistical issues for some families. Now, we were able to give them an option of either attending a 5-day coding camp event, or coming to the weekend conference, or both. For simplicity it now made more practical sense that families could make their individual travel arrangements, and the shorter commitment in terms of time meant that the associated cost of travel across the Festival was lower. 
 
By making the weekend finale open to young people who might not be able to attend the weekday coding camps in a regional hub, we now had a format where any young person in the country was able to take part in the Festival regardless of whether they had a regional hub in their locality - by just attending the weekend (and the cost of travel could be supported by our Access Scheme Fund).
 
This was an advantage in the final phase of ticket allocation, however it was unfortunate that we had to cancel some of the hubs that never received enough applications or volunteers support to run. At least we knew going into the week of the Festival itself that we were serving a smaller but very engaged group of events.

## 8. The Week <a name="week"></a>
 
Going into the week itself we ran hubs in Southampton, Sheffield, Plymouth and London (run by Sanzi, Elbrie, Chris and ourselves). Underland produced a series of explanatory videos to run as an introduction to each day's activities and give the same tone to all the sites even though they were in their respective natures quite different in terms of setting, size and the actual makeup of skills and personalities.
 
Inevitably attendees had degrees of shyness in the first hours of day one, but thanks in part to very positive communication from parents and guardians, which all hub leaders were fantastic about handling with the reassurance and support necessary, by the afternoon session of the first day all hubs were seeing signs of attendees getting settled in and integrating. In some cases they even brought along projects that they had previously been working on that they now had an opportunity to further explore supported by skill-sharing with a peer network. Sessions were well attended with low dropoff during the 5 days.
 
We established a communication network between hubs too where we could direct them to share what they were interested in or working on between sites, and we had really good social media coverage as a result. Mentors were able to follow through with projects for at least two or more consecutive days but in some cases much longer, and where possible we were even able to call in favours and get some more specialist minds to drop in and assist the attendees with specific topics.
 
The attendees did a great job of thinking well into basic and even advanced prototyping phases when testing their projects, and it was great to see that beyond working on their projects they were clearly making friends, and looking forward to coming back each day to continue working with their new team-mates.
 
A positive trait of there being some natural differences from hub to hub was that the leaders were able to introduce some broader ideas beyond the BASH Festival to attendees, that we could tailor towards their interests and personalities. Amongst others these included a tour of a university campus and where technical aspirations may lead, introduction to maker-spaces and fabrication technology, and some interactive career exploration. With some of the attendees, who had signed up for the weekday sessions only, there was further uptake of places at the weekend finale towards the end of the week as they were having such a good time.

## 9. The Weekend <a name="weekend"></a>
  
Overall dropoff of weekday participation to the weekend finale was approximately 30%, however in terms of unique attendees there was some whose first experience of the BASH Festival was arriving on Saturday at Millenium Point.
 
In the lead up to the festival week itself, Underland had been working with the in-house events team to accommodate delivery of a curated suite of workshops and talks that could be attended. The schedule gave young people a range of activity paces so they could selectively engage as much or as little as they were comfortable with, even forgoing the workshop activities or the more passive format of the talks in favour of using the designated breakout spaces to spend time coding or working on projects, and having the availability of a quiet space for their use when they felt the need.

![A series of images from the BASH Festival week events](/assets/posts/bash-weekend-tiles.png)
 
Despite the schedule itself being fairly well packed, the actual mood was quite relaxed. We anticipated that for a lot of our audience in the Festival - for many this was a lot more social interaction than they were used to expecting. As per the incident response policy, we put considerable effort into being prepared for something not going to plan or one of our attendees feeling that the Festival wasn't working for them. Luckily, we didn't have to implement anything further than some occasional basic guidance reminders for responsible behaviour.
 
The after dinner activities on Saturday were very social, though a few of the attendees simply didn't want to stop working on their projects. We took advantage of the fabulous auditorium at Millenium Point to do a film screening for the attendees, as well as laying on gaming activities, and even had a few young people feeling spoilt for choice and unsure as to whether they would get to do everything they had hoped. It was extremely rewarding to observe.
 
In short, everything went remarkably well. We made one significant format alteration on day two of the weekend in how the projects were presented and demonstrated, an informal science fair as opposed to individual presentations, because that suited the attendees as a more appropriate means by which they could engage with each other's work, but otherwise the reception from them regarding content and activities was extremely positive, and we finished off with a performance by friend of Underland and chiptune artist 2xAA, where he explained how he became a musician using 8-bit gaming audio technology and demonstrated his work.
  
## 10. Lessons Learned <a name="lessons"></a>

Was it all worth it? Absolutely. The attendees who took part in all 7 days had the most positive things to say about their experience, but the attendees who attended fewer parts still gave overwhelmingly positive feedback and though we didn't run any kind of strictly competitive format to the festival, we made sure to create commemorative pins for the young people who fully engaged with the events and developed a piece of work that they can be proud of.
 
![BASH Festival pin](/assets/posts/bash-pin.png)
 
The attendees responded particularly well to being in an environment where we specifically didn't treat them like they were at school. Mentoring took the form of structured guidance but was not mandatory instruction and giving these young people the chance to express themselves autonomously resulted in some really creative and interesting pieces of work. For the age-group involved, a less formal science fair was definitely more appropriate than enforced presentations of their work and it seems to have given them the chance to give their best on their terms.
 
As Underland, we've also learnt something valuable in that despite some inherited legacy of concept regarding what we wanted to achieve, making design choices in our event format that serve our audience first does work, and as a year-one exploration we've proved we can do this. It's got to be recognised that the “we” is a dedicated team of both employees and volunteers, as well as skilled industry peers and reliable vendors, and it's a lot of goodwill on all sides that made this happen.
 
On reflection we must also recognise that in a venture where the number of volunteers outnumbered core team members, with so many willing hands there were times when volunteer roles overlapped and it's not a bad thing to more clearly delineate these even if it's a support role, not because it's heavy handed in the process of taking help but because it more efficiently appreciates time freely given and ensures we don't waste it.
 
Our expectations of how much hub leaders should be handling should probably be scaled down in favour of alternative central mentor recruitment earlier in the planning - which would create small regional teams to bolster early uptake of places.
  
It's not impossible to repeat this format with higher uptake of spaces but the complexity of how we approach this is probably an iteration or two away from being refined to a point where we can run all of the hub sites we initially wanted to.

## 11. Big Learnings in Managing Expectations <a name="expectations"></a>
 
Probably the most unique facet to running a youth-tech event is managing the dual expectations of both parents and attendees. In this, we had more than a few surprises along the way, simply because parental expectations of young people might not be on the same page as ours in running this kind of event.
 
It's not our place or interest to get involved in the discrepancies between how different generations view technology and aspirations for further education or careers, but as organisers we were witness to instances where parents would sign up their children for places because of all manner of reasons that didn't serve the purpose of the Festival.

In a few cases we saw applications and even eventual attendees who were taking part to be agreeable to their parents, and then in turn would try to be agreeable to what they assumed our expectations of them. However, when presented with a situation that was not strictly pass/fail, and that pleasing their own expectations of what they might get out of doing a summer activity was an acceptable goal for what they might learn, this was uncharted but exciting territory for them. 

As much as these are not necessarily the young people who would be best served by what BASH offers, they are a clear reason as to why there is a place for more youth-tech events like this, and why they need to exist outside of traditional school environments but still provide the social benefits of a peer group with a common theme or focus.
 
## 12. Financial Overview <a name="finance"></a>
 
We committed at the very beginning of this event to provide a robust financial overview of the event. And here it is. 

We took a total of £24,583 in sponsorship for this event. £1,000 of it was specifically set aside by a sponsor to be used for the Access Scheme Fund. 

Rather than breaking down our preliminary budget I will say that we did extremely well in keeping food costs down through finding affordable and reliable vendors and sorting refreshments/snacks from a wholesaler. Here’s the breakdown of what we spent:

| Category | Costs | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Venue | £10,896 | Millenium Point venue hire |
| Team Travel, Sustenance & Lodging | £1,660.41 |  |
| Specialist Staffing | £1,318.15 |  |
| Collateral | 1,144.51 | Banners, stickers, tshirts |
| Marketing | £1,125 | Flyers & online ads |
| Food for event | 931.73 | We're extremely impressed by this |
| Safeguarding | £492.34 | DBS Checks |
| Access Scheme Fund Awards | £484.18 |  |
| Technical Kit for Projects | £64.06 |  |
| Misc | £1,089.35 |  |


In total we spent £19,205.73. We’ve decided to take the leftover money from the Access Scheme Fund and put it into the Inclusion Programme for [You Got This](https://yougotthis.io) - our January conference.

After this, £4,861.27 was left over which we have kept to somewhat offset the amount of time we put into this event. 

As a note, we spent about 120 days worth of hours on this event, which equates to about £48,000 of billable time. While we committed to pay for the time spent for this project if required, it’s worth noting the huge disparity between what we spent and what was left. 

# 13. The Future of BASH Festival of Code <a name="future"></a>
 
Despite the feedback and overall experience of running BASH Festival of Code being positive, we do not see Underland running it again in this format. With specific regard to the youth interest aspect the value is undeniable, but the excellent contributions of the young people who got involved aside, we have to approach any future similar event with the understanding that we can do this better, and a lot of that will have to come from further stripping away our own expectations of what a youth-tech event can be in favour of what the process of running this version has taught us it needs to be.
 
> I'd suggest that anybody who thinks they would like to try mentoring young people should give it a try. You don't have to know the answers to all their questions, or know everything about the technology they're working with. The main thing that you do as a mentor is to help talk through problems they encounter, provide some gentle encouragement towards their goal, and some guidance when they get stuck. It's also an awful lot of fun!
-- James Stoker - one of our hub mentors and weekend event volunteers.

Clearly we're working with the right skilled and talented people to deliver this kind of event, but some refinement of our logistical model is warranted. We've seen how much being ahead of the timescales that the academic year and other educational practitioners work on will be instrumental in preemptively reaching young people who will want to get involved, and them being at the centre of whatever form this takes in the future is something that must not change.
