title:  Why are we running a tech conference with no technical content?

In the past, both [Kevin](https://twitter.com/_phzn) and I have organised a fair number of tech events, from hackathons to conferences, and we realised that, while technical content at these events was quite abundant, there was a lack of resources on the skills that require emotional labour. These skills are critical for junior developers and designers to navigate the turbulent flow of the average workplace. Whether they’ve come straight out of university, are self-taught or in the middle of a career change, these skills matter and there’s no one to say exactly how much until you need them — a bit like filing your own taxes or opening your first bank account (for me, a quick ring to my dad was in order).

We’ve been running [Underland](https://underland.xyz) for a few months and have decided to run an event dedicated to these skills: [You Got This](https://yougotthis.io) — a one-stream conference in January for junior developers and designers, covering topics across three themes — learning, living and levelling-up. Apologies if it sounds like an origin story (I know that between the MCU and DCEU we’ve certainly had our fair share of them).

## All (some?) of the knowledge

In the beginning, little young me heard something from my parents that just stuck: “no one is born with all the knowledge.” And while big old me wishes that wasn’t the case, as it’d certainly make things a lot easier — albeit a bit dull, I must confess — it’s something I must come to terms with.

And having spoken to a few friends along the way, an issue some people struggle with. It is a daunting task to start fresh in a new work environment. Some of us feel the pressure to know everything. And while it is fine to keep challenging yourself, braving a brand-new world, it is also OK to look at an empty map and slowly, but surely, filling it up with your knowledge-tracks. Just as long as it’s not at the expense of your mental health and emotional energy.

## Stop and smell the roses

From a broader perspective, technology is constantly evolving and permeating every layer of what modern society depends on. I’ve read quite a few blog posts on developers being forced to do unspeakable things because of the bottom-line. The overall reaction was that they did what they had to do, but “If only I had said no”, is a common read. We should know that; we should learn how to say no and when enough is enough.

Work-life balance is something that takes a lot to master (if ever). In a world of deadlines and commitments, when do you stop? And once you do, how do you spend your new-found free time? Self-worth seemingly comes from your actions, and work-unrelated actions are just as important, if not more, to your overall wellbeing. We’ve all read stories of developers and entrepreneurs working 120 hour weeks. “It’s just for the time being, I’ll stop after”, we say.

We keep the finish line moving and only realise it’s a never-ending marathon once we’re forced to stop, gasping for air, wondering where all the water bottles have gone to. We enjoy the race, that’s why we’re doing what we’re doing. But there should be stops along the way, and maybe appreciate the scenery one in a while.

## You’re already levelled-up

You also should be aware of what your worth is. Some of us undersell our abilities, or even go as far as thinking we don’t belong. In this day and age, social media has us mostly looking at people’s grand achievements, instead of what it took to get there. Reality is ugly most of the times and a nice pre-set filter offsets all the nitty gritty details that otherwise cloud all the vibrant colours.

We need to appreciate our importance and stop playing down our feats and strengths. We do matter, we do belong, we will do great and we are going to be amazing!

## I, too, have much to learn

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t affected by most of these topics. I do struggle with saying no, maintaining healthy work hours and understanding my worth. I’m also aware that I’m privileged enough to be surrounded by amazing people and a beautiful community. A community keen on learning and teaching and everything in between.

I’m super excited about You’ve Got This, and hope you are too. You can register your interest on our [website](https://yougotthis.io) and submit a talk before the end of September 9 2018.

Hope to see you there!
