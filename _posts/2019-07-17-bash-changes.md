[BASH Festival of Code 2019](https;//bashfestival.io) is now just a few weeks away, and with that come some announcements of how we're making the event more flexible to attendees based on feedback we've been given.

As a reminder, BASH Festival of Code is a week-long coding festival for 13-17 year olds. In our original format, attendees would spend the first 5 days of the week in one of our regional hubs around the UK, and then travel to Birmingham for a finale where they will showcase projects and enjoy a multi-stream conference and lots of social activities. 

## Splitting the week and the weekend

What we've heard is that committing to the whole 7 days (including the travel) was a lot for some families, and as a result we've decided to split the week and the weekend portions so young people can choose to attend one or both parts as they prefer. All existing ticket holders have tickets to both halves without needing to do anything. This also means we can focus on engaging more people from the midlands to attend the weekend.

## Opening up BASH to all

As not all attendees will have been building projects for a week, so the weekend is now being framed as a hackathon - an invention marathon which will allow participants to build projects thrughout the weekend. Our hope is that the knowledge gained during the workshops can also now be applied to these projects, and potentially that week attendees might build a couple of projects throughout the whole 7 days.

This also means that anyone, even if there wasn't already a regional event near them, can get tickets to the weekend - only one set of travel supported by our Access Scheme Fund.

## Building during the week

The week is now more focused around learning & discovery, as well as starting to build projects to bring to the weekend. As the science fair presentations won't be the first thing on Saturday, they can also continue building over the weekend, with a special prize category for those who also attended the week.

## Roll up, roll up! 

There are still tickets available for the week-long events in [Bristol](http://bashfestival.io/events/bristol), [London](http://bashfestival.io/events/london), [Plymouth](http://bashfestival.io/events/plymouth), [Sheffield](http://bashfestival.io/events/sheffield) and [Southampton](http://bashfestival.io/events/southampton), as well as the [weekend finale in Birmingham](https://bashfestival.io/weekend). The whole event is free including food at the finale, with an Access Scheme Fund to support families who cannot afford travel to the weekend.

Please share this to teachers, parents and young people who might be interested.
